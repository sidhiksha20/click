        <legend>WHY DO YOU NEED US?</legend>
        <p >Stress is a normal psychological and physical reaction to demands in our lives. It is
            the way our bodies react physically, emotionally, mentally, and behaviorally to any
            change in the status quo. Even imagined change can cause stress.
            ÔÇ∑ Stress is highly individual. A situation that one person may find stressful may not
            bother another person. Stress occurs when something happens that we feel imposes
            a demand on us. When we perceive that we cannot cope, or feel inadequate to
            meet the demand, we begin to feel stress.<BR>
                <BR>
                    <BR>
            ÔÇ∑ Stress is not entirely bad. We need a certain amount of stress in our lives because it
            is stimulating and motivating. It gives us the energy to try harder and keeps us alert.
            ÔÇ∑ When we find ourselves in situations that challenge us too much, we react with the
            ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù stress response.
            ÔÇ∑ Stress actually begins in our brains and it is expressed in our body. Once we
            perceive stress, our body sends out chemical messengers in the form of stress
            hormones to help our bodies handle the stress.</p>

            <P >ÔÇ∑ 75 to 90% of all medical office visits are for stress-related ailments and complaints
                ÔÇ∑ stress is linked to the 6 leading causes of death in America ‚Äì heart disease, cancer,
                lung ailments, accidents, cirrhosis of the liver, and suicide
                ÔÇ∑ stress is also implicated in hypertension, smoking, obesity, alcoholism, drug abuse,
                gastrointestinal problems, arthritis, immune system disturbances, skin disorders,
                neurological conditions, etc.<BR><BR> Your reaction to stress is determined by a combination of factors including your physiology,
                past successes/failures in coping with stress, and interpretations of stressful events in your
                life. Managing stress effectively is a complex skill ‚Äì one you can learn with time and active
                participation. Cultivating constructive thinking, maintaining an optimistic and hopeful
                outlook, and altering patterns of negative thinking are some of the more important
                strategies. </P>
